#FF Clocks
A simple app for solving 'clock' problems like those in FF13-2.

Type the number of spots on the clock in the first box, click layout.  Then type each required step distance
into each of the new spots, then click solve to have those numbers replaced with the order in which each spot
should be visited.

Its basically brute force, but works pretty fast up to 20 spot clocks.
