# Sudoku

A simple 'sudoku' puzzle generator/solver.

Can solve puzzles of arbitrary difficulty, but for 'most' puzzles can also write out an english description of
the logic it used to solve it.

Can generate puzzles constrained by difficulty numbers for a difficulty ranking scheme that maps to how the solver is implemented.
